# Dessert Shop Ordering System

A simple GUI Dessert Shop Ordering System implemented using JavaFX, object-oriented programming (OOP) approach, basic networking with the Java.net package, and SQLite for data storage and retrieval.

## Features

### Client Features

- User Profile: Each client has a personal user profile.
- View Products: Clients can view the available products in the dessert shop.
- Add to Cart: Clients can add desired products to their shopping cart.
- Proceed to Checkout: Clients can proceed to the checkout process to complete their order.

### Admin Features

- Product Management: Admins have the ability to add, delete, and edit products.
- Database Management: The system stores and retrieves data using SQLite database.

## Technologies Used

- JavaFX: For building the graphical user interface.
- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP): Follows OOP principles for code organization and modularity.
- Java.net Package: Basic networking capabilities for communication between the client and server.
- SQLite: Used as the database to store and retrieve product and user information.

## Multithreading

The Dessert Shop Ordering System utilizes multithreading to handle concurrent client connections. Each client connection is handled in a separate thread, allowing multiple clients to interact with the system simultaneously. The Java.net package provides the necessary classes and APIs for implementing network communication and multithreading.
